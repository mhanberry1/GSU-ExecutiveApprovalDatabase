# Running the code locally
This site will be available online once it is finished. In the meantime it can be set up on any local machine that can run JSP.
A simple running environment willinclude a JSP server and an SQL server. The easiest way to achieve this is byt using XAMMP in conjunction with its TOMCAT plugin. (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) XAMPP is available for GNU/Linux, Windows, MacOSX, and Unix platforms. An introductory course to setting up and writing JSP is provided here:
